Fixes for 1.5.2
------------------
*) Changed getline rfc822 line wrap to check for validity of the next bits
   before attempting to see them
*) Changed imagemap.c so relative URLs actually work
*) Don't core dump on a method only request
*) reset errno to 0 in send_fp so we break out of loop
*) somewhere we stopped killing cgi scripts on SIGALRM and SIGPIPE
*) changed group handling support to support multiple groups again
*) reset content_length before scanning cgi headers, not after
*) don't free env var in replace (it uses allocate now)
*) Only look for path_info if its part of the requested URL (as opposed
   to keep looking until you hit a real directory)
*) Make make_dirstr() in util.c return / instead of null if n = 1

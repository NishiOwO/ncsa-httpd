Server Parse CGI output
   not feasible because SSI parser using buffered I/O, CGI uses getline()
   (server buffered I/O)
   But, we did it anyways.  See CGI_SSI_HACK in config.h
Allow extra CGI environment variables to be specified via configuration

   Shouldn't be too hard, probably in 1.5.1b4
   Ok, maybe in 1.5.2
AuthUserScript - Heiner Schorn (Heiner.Schorn@informatik.umu.se)
   Pass a user name to a script, it returns the password to check against
   the one the client sent to the server.  This is safe from someone 
   writing a script to gather passwords, because the given password is
   never sent to the script.  This is unsafe on the server system because
   it will return the password of a user.  That could be made safer by
   making the mechanism employ crypt on the password before hand..
   Shouldn't be too hard, but needs some design work.  Perhaps 1.5.1b4
   Ok, maybe 1.5.2
Have separate UID/GID per CGI script - Marc Evans (marc@destek.net)
   With Patch (NF-1.5b7-marc_cgi_uid_hack)
   Basically, changes calls from setuid to seteuid, so it changes the 
   effective user id of the server.  This makes any security hole
   potentially dangerous, such as the one in 1.3, since the program
   that you can force to run can set the euid back to root.
   Look at it for 1.5.1b4, probably always have to be a #define for the
   more security conscious users of NCSA HTTPd
   Push off to 1.5.2
SHTTP
   Alpha is done, but we need to test it more
SSL
   Again, alpha code is in place, but it needs to be tested more
RADIUS
   Ok, I was expecting something slightly different.  Doesn't quite fit
   the current way of doing things, but shouldn't be too hard to figure
   out either.  Probably 1.5.2
